# Ionic 5 Slider issue

The [Controller](https://swiperjs.com/api/#controller) module in Swiper doesn't seem to work in Ionic 5.

Any help to fix or understand this better would be appreciated.

## To run

`git clone ...`

`cd ...`

`npm i`

`ionic serve`

Swipe the 'content' slider. The 'header' slider should also swipe accordingly but it doesn't.
